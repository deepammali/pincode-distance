# PINCODE DISTANCE

## Used [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding) to convert Pincode to Latitude and Longitude

## Used [Google Maps Routes API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes) to get different routes from the origin coordinates to destination coordinates

### **Please log in to Google Console and create API KEY for using both these services from a single key and place it in application.properties file.
